    <p>
            I am an aspiring developer and intern ready to give my all to a 
            great, nurturing company. My name is Shaniqua Rayford. I graduated 
            Cum Laude with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science from the 
            University of Memphis in December 2014. 
    </p>
    
    
    <p>        
            Throughout the past four years, I have developed programming 
            skills and is mostly proficient in Java and C#. Currently I live in 
            Memphis, TN and work at Ducks Unlimited as an IT Intern. For my 
            previous work experience I was an IT Intern and Industrial 
            Engineering Intern at Jabil Circuit. 
            
    </p>
    
    <p>
            
            I have a passion for technology and a strong interest in Software 
            Engineering. I have taken computer programming courses such as 
            Software Engineering and math courses such as Calculus 2 earning
            A's and B's in all of my Computer Science courses. I have developed 
            applications for school projects and I developed a mobile webpage 
            for a summary of order details while working at Jabil Circuit. 
            I hope to expand my knowledge of computer 
            programming and web development so that I may become a skilled 
            developer.
    </p>     
    
    <p>
            I desire this career so that I can help people solve 
            complicated problems and make their lives easier. 
    </p>
